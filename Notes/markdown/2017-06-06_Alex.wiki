Centered sensor to pick up laser, so we can measure the period.

Current time required to write to log is large, can we cut it down?
Sets at "done with current querry!" for too long as it writes data to dataframe

== Torsion Constant Calculations ==

For the given apparatus, we can get the torsion constant by the equation

$ \kappa = 4\pi^{2} \frac{I}{T^2} $

where:
* $ \kappa= $ torsion constant
* $ I= $ Moment of inertia of system
* $ T= $ Period

For the moment of inertia, we have three main parts:
* wire
* mount
* hoop

From these, the mount and hoop are relatively simple, since if they rotate, they will rotate entirely. The wire may be challenging, as the bottom attached to the mount will rotate entirely, but the top will not at all. For example:

Suppose the pendulum sweeps through $360^o$, then the hoop and the mount will rotate through $360^o$, but the wire will have a gradiant of rotation, from $360^o$ at the base to $0^o$ at the top. If we assume a linear progression ($360^o$ at bottom, $180^o$ at middle, $0^o$ at top), then can we approximate the fiber as a rigid rod of half the length? Couple of articles found seem to indicate that the effect is negligible enough to just approximate it as a rigid cylinder.
