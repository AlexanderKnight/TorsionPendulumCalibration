    "### Apparatus\n",
    "Our aparatus consists of three orthogonal Helmholtz coils that are capable of negating earth's magnetic field. In the center of the coils we suspend a magnet on the end of a long small diameter torsion fiber. To measure the rotation of the magnet, we shine a laser onto a mirror attached to the magnet and catch the reflected light with a optical sensor \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The field in the center of the coils is relatively uniform and we are able to control the X and Y coils with $\\pm$ 3 nano Tesla and the Z coil to $\\pm$ SOME NUMBER. The torsion pendulum is most sensitive to torques allong the axis of the torson fiber so with some work, we can measure the horizontal component of the earth's magnetic field.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " From this we will build a magnetic field sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Earth's field\n",
    "First off, the earth's field is aproximately $57mT$ most of it is in the z direction. the horizontal component of the field is around $22 mT$ so our adustment coils need to at least be capable of negating this strength field. The power supplies can provide almost an amp of current for the x and y coil. In *current space* the capibilities of our aparatus are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Frequency of ocilation\n",
    "As the magnetic field goes to zero the magnet on the torsion fiber's frequency of occilation about its equilibrium position will drop to a constant minimum (that of the torsional torque only). To measure the frequency of occilations we use a mirror attached to the pendulum. a laser and a 4 quadrent ccd sensor give us angle crossings of $\\pm .33E-3 degrees$ with a timing acuracy of $\\pm 1e-3$ seconds\n",
    "the draw backs to this meathod are that by measuring the angle at one position only we can only obtain one component of the magnetic field directly. However, the perpendictular component can be infered from the shape of the frequncy vs field plot or it could be measured directly by adding a second mirror to the aparatus. \n"

    "### Field Space\n",
    "An important innital calibration of the aparatus is to get the field in the center of the coils as a function of current through each helmholtz coil. This allows us to define the coil's influence in field space. Field space is the clearest way to develop our model for mesuring the earth's magnetic field.\n",

Any external field will move the origin in absolute field space. Assuming we have correctly configued our coils to work in the direction which opposes the earth's field, and with enough strength to overcome it, the absolute zero field value will lie somewhere in the range of our coils. We will theoretically be able to reach zero field to within the smallest adustment of our coil power supplies. \n",
